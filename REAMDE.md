# Texas Holdem

A simple webapp I'm building for playing texas holdem remotely.

The goal is to build something that's easy to host and to use.

## What it does
- Allows a game of texas holdem
- Admin is the dealer
- Automatically announces the winner of a hand (shows their cards)
- Last player automatically wins (doesn't show cards)
- Players can enter and leave at any time
- Players can fold

## What's next
The todo list in todo.txt contains a details breakdown, but here's a high level version:
- Add chips and a pot system

## Hosting
It's a node app, so all you have to do is clone to repo to server, install the dependencies and then start a node process pointed at server.js.
