## Done:
[x] Deal hands to players
[x] Deal cards
[x] Basic visualisation
[x] Server
	- Game stored on server
		- PHP or JS?
		- Hosting?
			- Can be ephemeral, as long as the storage of state isn't
			- Need to store the state file somewhere
			- Would need basic security
				- Ensure someone can't mess with it by posting dodgy data
				- Means the server needs to control the data
				- Need a hosting client with data storage that isn't horribly slow
				- Admin is the one that starts the game?
			- Digital ocean droplet will work, as I only need file storage
	[x] Game state stored on server
		- Triggered by button presses
	[x] Changes one client are updated in another
[x] Gracefully handle clients refreshing
    - When a client disconnects they become a new player, player 2 becomes player 1, etc . . .
    - Ideally I want it to handle it gracecfully.
        - Browser close causes player to leave
        - Refresh causes a new socket connection for the same player
[x] Show other players
	[x] Show new players
	[x] Remove old players
[x] Player seats
[x] Seats in order and Empty seats
[x] Player 1 controls the game
[x] Render downward facing cards
[x] Handle bug when same user closes one active window with others open
	- Don't allow multiple windows
[x] Player names
[x] Style it better
	- Backround colour
	- Cards in center
	- Tables are center
[x] Name stored in cookie
[x] Change name	
	- Handled via 'changeName=1' URL param
[x] Buttons in better position
[x] Refresh breaks the app for everyone, fix this
	- No longer breaks game
	- Refreshed player can no longer see cards, have to wait for next deal
	- Other players can continue as normal
[x] Introduce concept of "Round"
	[x] Dealing starts a round
	[x] At end of a round all cards are shown
[x] Folding
	- A user can fold their hand in a round at any time
	- They are out of the round
[x] Show cards after river betting is finished	
[x] Choose winning hand
	- Use this lib https://www.npmjs.com/package/poker-ranking
	- Currently installed
	- Select all active hands
	- Choose winner
	- Send message with winner and their hand
[x] Highlight winner
[x] Pretty it up some more
[x] Announce default winner of hand
	- Announce when all other hands are folded
	- Do not show cards
[x] Mobile player
	- Full screen horizontally
[x] Host it at an IP
[x] Pass control to player when host leaves
[x] Pass controls back when host returns
	- Just give the controls to the first player and remove them from the second
[x] Handle refresh
	- Emit all the events to the player that refreshed
	- Broadcasts community cards and the players current cards
[x] Remove cards of players that leave
[x] Host it at a URL
    - Hosted on a bitly URL, good enough for now
[x] Restart node process if it fails
    - Went with Supervisord, good enough
[x] Add concept of a game
[x] Write domain events (documentation)
    - Documentation only
    - Plan is to migrate to domain events internally, use them to build up game state
[x] Use domain events internally in system
[x] Convert deck from a VO with state into a projection
    - How to do this?
        1. Store a seed, spin up a newly shuffled deck from that seed each time a card is needed
        2. Store an event with the shuffled deck
        3. Store an event with the shuffled deck (series of ints)
    - Gonna give "1" a try
[x] Refactor into subclasses
    - The file is getting quite large
[x] Choose a dealer at the start of each round
    - Choose the next active player to the left of the current dealer
[x] Bet a sum of money
    - Display this to everyone
    - Express JS does not come with request body parsing enabled by default
        - Have to install middleware for this
        - Really strange decision
[x] Chips are put into the pot once the next cards are placed
[x] Players have chips, betting subtracts from chips
[x] Winner takes the pot
[x] Can only bet the number of chips you currently have
[x] Hide deal button in middle of round
[x] Can only bet during a round of betting
    - Disable betting once a winner is announced
    - Enable once the cards are dealt
[x] WinningByDefault also results in winning chips
[x] Pot is updated on bet, not on round completion
    - There's currently a bug were you can only win a pot if a round of betting has finished
    - This is a bit rubbish
[x] Show Total player bet, not the amount they just bet
    - It currently shows the last amount bet, not the total bet in this round
[x] Once you're out of chips you're out of the game
    - Only occurs at the end of a round
    - Controls are disabled
    - Can only watch the current game
    - Is not dealt cards
    - At the HTML level, figuring out what this looks like there
        - Rendering facedown cards should be done based on playerIds passed in the message
        - Allows the server side to control it, at the moment it's relying to DOM state, which is bad
    - Hide bankrupted players on the next game start
    - Also bankrupt players when winning by default happens
[x] Use rooms for each game, allows multiple games to work simultaneously
[x] Add basic security
    - Can't pretend to be another player
[x] Only admin can deal cards
[x] Auto small/big blinds
[x] Clear betting input after bet
[x] Fix bug with number of chips displayed
    - Fold causing that issue
[x] Do not allow negative bets
[x] Fix bug when person joins or refreshes it resets the current game
[x] Write tests for domain
[x] Extract domain and application projections
[x] Add caching for projections
    - This turned out to be a lot of fun
    - Means I can call projections with impunity, there is practically no cost to multiple calls
[x] Disconnecting does not remove a player from the game
    - Display icon to indicate they're gone
    - At end of round, disconnected players are removed
    - Delete game when all players are disconnected
        - Also resets when the only player refreshes
        - Fine for now
[x] Indicate next player to make a bet
    - Much trickier to implement than I'd thought
    - No idea were to start, theres just too much data for a single projection
        - Maybe use multiple projections then
    - Rules:
        - Who is the next player in this round that has yet to "act"
            - Goes through in the order of seats
        - Only factor in active players
        - Ignore the first bets of the small and big blinds
        - If everyone has acted and everyone has bet the same amount, then it's nobodies turn\
    [x] Build projection
    [x] Next round bet highlight not working
        - First bet raised, didn't highlight second player
    [x] Enable control for next player, disable for others
    [x] Show how much the next player has to pay to play
[x] Admins can transfer chips to others
[x] Bug: Folded players should not be the next player
[x] Bankrupt players do not see current game happening
[x] Bankrupt player are still considered in the game
[x] Bankrupted players cannot see game in progress
[x] Disconnected players are not removed from the game
[x] Fix broken hand
    - A hand that shouldn't have won has won
        - winner: 8H, KD
        - loser: KC, JH
        - community: 5C, 4S, JD, 4D, 8D
    - Wrote a test to reproduce, it's now picking the right hand
    - Took a log of the entire game, will reproduce in a testcase and check the result
        - That didn't help, a replay of the game leads to the correct winner
        - It's bizarre, it always chooses the right winner, except in the same we're looking at
    - Look into another poker engine
    - The issue was caused by duplicate community card, issues with JS arrays being mutable references rather than copies
[x] Broadcast in-progress hand on refresh
    - Old implementation was broken, so it's been deleted
    - New solution is to replay all the notifications sent from the beginning of the game or round
        - Seems to work fine, causes a flicker on the screen, that's it
[x] Admin allows a player to buy back into the game
    - Workaround is to leave the game and rejoin in incognito mode
        - Good enough for now
[x] Next round cannot start until everyone has put in the same amount
    - Or a player has put in all their chips
[x] Write broadcast notifications

## Todo:
[x] Game should auto-deal cards/flop/turn/river/finish
    - Easy enough to do right now TBH
    - Add a delay of 5 seconds
[x] Once no further bets can be made (e.g. all players are all in) then the game should autoplay
    - In progress, getNextPlayerToAct projection needs to figure out if betting is even possible
        - Get all active players
        - Do more than one of them have remaining chips?
[x] Once the game ends and a winner is announced the game should not keep playing by itself
[ ] Admin gives players chips
[ ] Handle case when player does not have enough chips to play
    [x] Players can go in all in even it's less than the required amount
    [ ] Max bet in a round is the lowest players remaining chips count
    [ ] Players can only win a proportion of what they've bet


[ ] Show hand titles

[ ] Handle pots
	- Currently defaults to the first handle winning
	- This is fine for now, as draws are so rare
