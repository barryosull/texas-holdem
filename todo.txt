[x] Server
	- Game stored on server
		- PHP or JS?
		- Hosting?
			- Can be ephemeral, as long as the storage of state isn't
			- Need to store the state file somewhere
			- Would need basic security
				- Ensure someone can't mess with it by posting dodgy data
				- Means the server needs to control the data
				- Need a hosting client with data storage that isn't horribly slow
				- Admin is the one that starts the game?
			- Digital ocean droplet will work, as I only need file storage
