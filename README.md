# Texas Hold'em

![Texas Hold'em](https://circleci.com/gh/barryosull/texas-holdem.svg?style=svg)

A simple webapp I'm building for playing texas holdem remotely.

The goal is to build something that's easy to host and to use.

## What it does
- Allows people to play a game of texas holdem.
- Currently all or nothing on the pot.
- Still a WIP

## What's next
The todo list in todo.txt contains a details breakdown, but here's a high level version:
- Add chips and a pot system

## Hosting
It's a node app, so all you have to do is clone to repo to server, install the dependencies and then start a node process pointed at server.js.
