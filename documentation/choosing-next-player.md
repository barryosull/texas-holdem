# Choosing  the next player bug

There is a bug currently were a user is chosen as the next player even though there should be no next player.

E.g. playerA goes all in with 100 chips, then playerB with 200 calls the 100.
This should mean the round is over, but instead it loops back to playerA, asking them to act.
